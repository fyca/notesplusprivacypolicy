    <h1>Privacy Policy for NotesPlus</h1>
    
    <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 2025</p>
    
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how NotesPlus ("we", "our", or "the app") handles information when you use our Android application. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about our data practices.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>NotesPlus is a note-taking application developed by Lost Sierra Apps. This privacy policy applies to the Android application with package name <strong>com.lostsierra.notesplus</strong>. We believe in privacy by design, and this policy reflects our commitment to protecting your data.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not collect any personal information.</strong> NotesPlus does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data, user information, or usage analytics. The app operates entirely offline and does not communicate with any external servers or services.</p>
    
    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect any information, there is no data to use, process, or analyze. All note content, notebooks, templates, and app settings are stored locally on your device using the device's local database. This data is never transmitted to us or any third parties.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>All data created and stored within NotesPlus remains exclusively on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Notes, notebooks, and templates are stored in a local database on your device</li>
        <li>App settings and preferences are stored locally on your device</li>
        <li>No data is transmitted to external servers or cloud services</li>
        <li>No data is shared with third parties</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The app uses Android's standard local storage mechanisms. Your data is protected by your device's security settings. We recommend that you maintain appropriate security measures on your device, such as screen locks and regular backups if desired.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Share Feature</h2>
    <p>NotesPlus includes a share feature that allows you to share individual notes with other applications or services of your choice. This feature operates as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sharing is entirely optional and user-initiated</li>
        <li>Only the specific note content you choose to share is transmitted</li>
        <li>You control which notes to share and with which applications</li>
        <li>No personal information or metadata is included in shared content</li>
        <li>Once shared, the data is handled according to the privacy policies of the receiving application or service</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not have access to or control over data once it has been shared through your device's share functionality.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>NotesPlus does not integrate with any third-party analytics services, advertising networks, or data collection services. The app does not use:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Analytics or tracking services</li>
        <li>Crash reporting services</li>
        <li>Advertising networks</li>
        <li>Social media integrations</li>
        <li>Cloud storage services</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The app uses only standard Android system libraries and components necessary for app functionality.</p>
    
    <h2>7. Android Backup</h2>
    <p>NotesPlus may use Android's built-in backup system to allow your device to back up app data. This backup is handled entirely by your device and Google account settings. Backups are stored in your personal Google account and are subject to Google's privacy policies. We do not have access to these backups.</p>
    
    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>NotesPlus does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. Since we do not collect any data, the app is safe for users of all ages. Parents and guardians should be aware that if children use the share feature, they may share content with other applications, which are subject to their own privacy policies.</p>
    
    <h2>9. Permissions</h2>
    <p>NotesPlus requests minimal permissions necessary for app functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage/File Access:</strong> Required to save and export notes, and to import shared note files</li>
        <li><strong>Share Functionality:</strong> Required to share notes with other applications</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No permissions are used to collect personal information or transmit data to external servers.</p>
    
    <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically. Continued use of the app after any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
    
    <h2>11. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since all your data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over it:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can view, edit, or delete any notes or data at any time</li>
        <li>You can uninstall the app, which will remove all app data from your device (unless you have backups enabled)</li>
        <li>You can export your data using the app's export features</li>
    </ul>
